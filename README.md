**Abstract**

> ##### The determination of sex from dental structures is of great relevance in human identification processes. However, specific reference standards of the population are lacking in countries like Mexico. Objetive: our objective was to analyze the reliability of mesiodistal (MD) canine distance from adult dental models with known data to determine sex. Design: Intra and interobserver tests of the measures recorded by four observers were used. Additionally, parametric statistical methods (descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and logistic regression models) were employed to identify the relationship of measures and sex differences. Results: we found more significant dimorphism in the left maxillary MD and left and right mandibular MD measurements. Conclusion: Through the MD method and results, a 95% confidence interval was determined for the measures with more significant dimorphism. Our study represents another tool for forensic practice that may assist the delimitation of sex to identify thousands of people in Mexico.
